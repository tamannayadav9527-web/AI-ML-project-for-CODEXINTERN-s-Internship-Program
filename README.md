Machine Learning Internship Project
# Introduction

This project is developed as part of my CODEXINTERN's Internship Program for the month of August, 2025.
The goal of this internship is to gain in-depth knowledge of Machine Learning concepts, apply them to real-world datasets, and build end-to-end ML models that demonstrate practical skills.

The program combines structured training, guided assignments, and independent project work to ensure both learning and hands-on implementation.

# Internship Timeline

 .Training on Python, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning basics
 . Advanced Machine Learning algorithms & project selection
 . Implementation of the internship project (model development, testing & evaluation)
 . Final project completion, documentation, and submission
